# Cyclistic-Bike-Study
Description: An end to end analysis of how to drive conversion rates from casual riders to members for a fictional company called Cyclistic

Case Study 1.pdf describes the motivation of the project, the background context, and states the goal of the project: to determine the differences between casual riders and members who use Cyclistic. These insights will be used to drive conversion from casual rider to members.

All data was taken from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. In this particular analysis, we used data from August 2022 to July 2023 which contained 5.7 million rows of data and 13 columns. Due to computing limitations, I chose to limit the data analysis to 1 year's worth of data.

"Case_Study_1_Bikes.ipynb" is the jupyter notebook containing all diagrams and data extraction work.

"Cyclistic Ad Campaign.pdf" is a powerpoint presentation containing the summaries and most important insights.

"Cyclistic Bike Share Report.pdf" is a report describing the detailed findings and insights from this end to end analysis.
